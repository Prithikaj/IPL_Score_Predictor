Predictive IPL Match Analyzer                                           
Developed the IPL Match Analyzer using Flask, a sophisticated system powered by machine learning to predict IPL scores with 
95% accuracy. The project involved designing and implementing a robust framework that integrates advanced regression 
techniques to improve prediction quality. Enhanced the systemâ€™s performance by 30% by refining regression methods and 
optimizing data processing workflows, resulting in faster response times and highly precise score predictions.
